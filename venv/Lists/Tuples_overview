a tuple is an ordered immutable list of elements
1) once created it's elements can not be changed
2) it is fixed in size at the time of creation length can not be modified
3) can hold elements of different types
4)used to store heterogeneous data of different types
5) it is basically a read only data type which makes it faster than a list
6) it allows duplicate elements
7) you can search

ex:
    myTuple = (1, "a", "a", "b", false, "a", "a", 29)
                    or
    myTuple = 1, "a", "b", false, 29

if you only have one element in your tuple you must add a comma next to it
    ex: myTuple = "a",      or      myTuple = ("a",)

  METHODS:
1) tuple() turns any list to a tuple and list() turns tuple to list
2) you can find elements by index ex: myTuple[0] gives you the 1st element
3) negative index also give you the last item, second to last etc...
4) you can not change values in tuples so mytuple[0] = "something" will give you an error.
5) len(myTuple) gives you the length of the tuple
6) count() counts how many instances of something you have inside your tuple
    ex: myTuple.count("a") <-- returns 4 because there are four "a" in your list
7) index() finds the first occurrence of that element
    ex: myTuple.index("a") <-- gives you 1 because that is where the first instance is
8) slicing is the same way with list and tuples
    ex: myTuple[2:7] gives you all elements from idx 2 to 6 not including 7
     works the same way as with lists

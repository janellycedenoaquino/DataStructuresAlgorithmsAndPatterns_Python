# itertools: product, permutations, combinations, accumulate, groupby & infinite iterators

# product
a = [1,2]
b = [3]
prod = product(a,b) --> [(1, 3), (2, 3)]
prod = product(a, b, repeat=2) --> [(1, 3, 1, 3), (1, 3, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1, 3), (2, 3, 2, 3)]

if you don't specify repeat it will only combine once
if you repeat 2x it will combine both ways so 1,3 and 3,1


# permutations
a = [1, 2, 3] -->
gives all different possible permutations
